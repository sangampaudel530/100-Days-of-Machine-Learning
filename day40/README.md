# Day 40: Multivariate Imputation (MICE)

## Overview
Explored multivariate imputation using the MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) approach to handle missing values by leveraging relationships among multiple features.

## What I Learned
- How to iteratively impute missing values using regression models
- The concept of chained equations for multivariate imputation
- Comparing simple mean imputation with iterative, model-based methods
- The importance of repeating the process until changes are minimal

## Key Implementation
- Introduced missing values in a small dataset
- Used linear regression to predict and fill missing values based on other columns
- Repeated the process for each feature with missing data
- Compared results after each iteration to check for convergence

## Skills Developed
- Advanced missing data handling
- Iterative imputation logic
- Understanding when to use multivariate imputation

## Key Takeaway
MICE provides more accurate imputations by considering the relationships between features, especially when missingness is
