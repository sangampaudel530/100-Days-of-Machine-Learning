#  100 Days of Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Machine Learning** journey!  
This repository contains my daily progress, notebooks, and learnings based on the **CampusX Official** YouTube series by **Nitish Singh Sir**.  

I embarked on this challenge to build a strong foundation in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, while applying concepts practically through code.
