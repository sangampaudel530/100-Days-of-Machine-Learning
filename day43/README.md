# Day 43: Outlier Detection and Removal with IQR

## Overview
Learned how to detect and handle outliers in data using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and visualized the effects of trimming and capping on the placement exam marks feature.

## What I Learned
- Calculating IQR and using it to define outlier boundaries (fences)
- Identifying and removing (trimming) outliers
- Capping extreme values to the nearest fence
- Visualizing distributions before and after outlier treatment with KDE and boxplots

## Key Skills
- Outlier detection and handling
- Data cleaning for robust analysis
- Effective data visualization

## Takeaway
Properly managing outliers improves data quality and leads to more
