# Day 23: Feature Scaling - StandardScaler Implementation

## Overview
Deep dive into feature scaling using StandardScaler on Social Network Ads dataset, understanding the mathematical foundation and practical impact of standardization.

## What I Learned
- **Standardization Theory**: Zero mean, unit variance transformation
- **StandardScaler Implementation**: Sklearn preprocessing pipeline
- **Scale Impact Analysis**: Before/after comparison techniques
- **Algorithm Performance**: Effect on distance-based algorithms
- **Data Distribution**: Preservation of shape during scaling

## Key Implementation
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df.drop('Purchased', axis=1), df['Purchased'], test_size=0.2
)

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Model comparison
model_original = LogisticRegression()
model_scaled = LogisticRegression()
```

## Dataset Analysis
- **Features**: Age and EstimatedSalary
- **Target**: Purchase decision (binary classification)
- **Scale Difference**: Age (20-60) vs Salary (15k-150k)
- **Impact**: Significant improvement in algorithm performance

## Visualization Insights
- **Before Scaling**: Different feature ranges dominate
- **After Scaling**: Balanced feature contributions
- **Distribution Shape**: Preserved after transformation
- **Scatter Plots**: Improved data visualization clarity

## Performance Results
- **Without Scaling**: Biased toward high-value features
- **With Scaling**: Balanced feature importance
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Measurable performance gains
- **Convergence**: Faster algorithm convergence

## Skills Developed
- Mathematical understanding of standardization
- Proper scaling workflow implementation
- Performance impact assessment
- Visual comparison techniques
- Preprocessing pipeline design

## Next Steps
Foundation for exploring other scaling techniques like MinMaxScaler and RobustScaler.
